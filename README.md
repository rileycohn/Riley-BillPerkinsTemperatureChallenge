graph_temperature_data.py generates a total of 5 graphs:

1. Average, min, max temperate weighted by population for every day between 1/1/2015 - 4/20/2021
2. Monthly aggregated average, min, max of the same population weighted temperate data

After the first 2 graphs are generated, the program will ask you which city you'd like to see data for. Upon entering a valid city you will be presented with 3 additional graphs, each of which will display whether the data for each day was provided in the dataset or if the program came up with an estimate for that day.

1. Average temperature for each day in your provided city
2. Minimum temperature for that day in your provided city
3. Maximum temperature for that day in your provided city
